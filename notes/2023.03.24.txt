I'm officially doing the react course.
I thought I'd get away from courses after finishing the webdev bootcamp.
I finished the react tutorial and I finished all of the extra steps that were involved. 

Path to becoming a full stack engineer:

1. finish learning react
2. learn to use postgre 
3. learn system design
4. brush up on data structures and algos
5. software arch
6. optimization.

I have a long journey ahead of me. 

I also have things I want to accomplish.
When I don't feel like doing my course, I'll work on my personal projects.

1. Portfolio/blog
2. algo datastructure visualizer
3. create an API

STOP THINKING ABOUT WHAT IS BETTER JUST DO THINGS!!!!!

ULTIMATE GOAL
MAKE A GAME WITH NFTs and break even
