I'm currently high on norcos because I got my wisdom teeth out.

I don't have anything to do, but I want to do stuff.
I don't have anything to do, but I don't want to do anything.

Life is hard.
My life is easy.

I am lost.
I am seeking.

I have found. 
I don't take action.

I look and long for the future.
I see it, I dream it.
When I get there, I'm unhappy.

I want to be present.
When I'm present I put in good work.

I wish to stop living in the future.
I wish to stop wishing.

I want to stop wishing.
I want to start doing.
