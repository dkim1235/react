I thought this would be quicker than my web dev class.
It took about 2 years for me to finish it. I learned a lot.
I think this time it'll be much quicker than that. 
What I should do is I should look at how long it took me to finish the web dev class and how long it took me to finish this react course.
Of course finishing this react course gave me the backround knowledge to finish this course faster.

For some reason when I recall taking the webdev course I felt like I was dragging my feet. 
I'm not sure if it's because it was difficult and it was all new to me.
