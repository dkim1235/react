today I want to spend the day refactoring code and making it more organized from a styled components perspective. 
I can spend some time trying to replicate what Max did in the practice project. I think I want to get to a point where I don't have to look at the reference code and be able to use react on the fly.

try using theme for the user case. 

what I noticed is that I didn't create a list of things I want to do. 
I had a broad general idea and it was massive. I started but it wasn't efficient because I was trying to do everything all at once. 
It's too much...
Especially with how complex things are now. I used to be able to do this, and now I need to break out of the habbit of doing this. 

currently do not think about using styled components. Use the CSS flow and method that Max uses. 

- add user component
- add re-usable card component
- add re-usable Button
- add user Input state
- add validation and reset logic
- users list component
- manage list of users via state.
- add error modal.
- manage error state.
- re-arrange directories and components from bullet-proof react. 

- convert using styled components
- convert to ts


notes on what I don't remember

- I don't remember how to start a react function.
- I don't know html well enough for forms etc. 
	- html forms

- form input id
- form button type

- form react router onSubmit.
- react event handler for form submit
