when trying to implement css that the course is implementing styling.
I want to convert everything into styled components because that's what I'd like to use long term and gain mastery on.

I need to take steps instead of trying to leap into a solution.

I think I have this habbit because when I was a kid taking math courses I would be able to make leaps into solutions.

What I'm doing now is more complex and takes more thought.

Take things step by step.

Step one is to use the css implementation.
Step two is to convert it into styled components.
