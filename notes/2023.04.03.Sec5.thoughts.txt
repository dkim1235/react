I was thinking about it. 
I was extremely un-motivated at work and extremely unmotivated at my personal project.
I think it's because All I'm doing is learning but not executing.
Because I'm constantly learning and I feel like I'm "re-learning" pieces of react from my tutorial, I feel like I'm stuck.
What I decided to do is skip the lectures for now.
I can watch them on my own later.
What I can do now to help with my learning fateague is just do the section 8 small project. 
I'll use bootstrap and react to make this thing. 
I'll use the lecture titles as guidelines for what I should be doing step by step.

1. Adding "user" component
2. Adding re-usable "card" component
3. Adding re-usable "button" component
4. managing the user input state
5. adding validation & resetting logic
6. adding a users list component
7. managing a list of users via state
8. adding "errorModal" component
9. managing the error state
